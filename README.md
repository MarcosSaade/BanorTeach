# Banorteach - Personalized Financial Education App

Banorteach is an innovative financial education app that uses AI-driven scenarios and gamified learning to help users of all experience levels improve their financial knowledge and decision-making. Designed for a Hackathon by Banorte and coded in under 24 hours, this app leverages both experience and game-based learning techniques to simulate real-life financial situations, providing personalized feedback and tailored advice.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

Our goal is to make financial literacy accessible, engaging, and personalized for everyone. Inspired by educational models like Duolingo, Banorteach incorporates interactive scenarios where users navigate through life-like financial challenges. Each scenario adapts to the user's specific profile, taking into account personal factors such as income, family situation, and career. This way, users can make financial decisions in a risk-free environment and learn from both successes and failures.

### Why Banorteach?
Many people struggle with financial literacy because learning about finances can be daunting. Banorteach simplifies this by combining two effective learning methods:

1. **Experience:** Users face personalized financial simulations and scenarios based on their unique situations, with outcomes influenced by their choices. 
2. **Game-based Learning:** Engaging, interactive learning experiences make the app fun while fostering the brain's ability to build stronger learning connections through play.

Banorteach is designed to simulate real financial life so users can make mistakes in the app and avoid them in real life.
